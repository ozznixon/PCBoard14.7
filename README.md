## PCBoard Pascal Clone

This project is being built by Myself and my Pascal Students. The primary focus was to build a project that the class could experiment with.

# Primary Focuses:
* Learn the Pascal Language - using a Turbo Pascal 7.1 Clone that I wrote.
* Build a core Communications Library
* Build a code Screen TUI Library
* Build a new script engine - using Pascal, running Pascal.
* Contact Sam Smith (Author of ProDoor and ProKit), getting permission to use the source in this project. [✓]
* Contact Mark May (Author of MKMsg Source), getting permission to take the lead on keeping MKMSG evolving. [✓]
* Aquire Portal of Power v7 full source (Contacted in 2024, and I have been tearing it down by functionality. [✓]
* Even though I have PCBoard 15.4 source - this project is an operational reverse engineering of 14.5
* * Meaning, we run PCB 14, to figure out what it is doing, and code it from scratch.

### Design Changes
1. We are going to use PCB MSGS and QUICKBBS HUDSON are our primary message base designs.
2. We will introduce MKMSG, so conferences can leverage J.A.M., Squish, EZYCOM message engines [ as options ]
3. Introduce native FIDO functionality into the WFC (Wait for Call) screen/loop.
